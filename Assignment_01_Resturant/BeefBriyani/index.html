        <center>To prepare Beef Biryani, the meat is typically marinated with a mixture of yogurt, ginger, garlic, and
            an
            array of spices, including cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. This marination process allows the
            meat to absorb the flavors and become tender and flavorful.

            aromatic spices such as cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and bay leaves. Saffron or food coloring is often added
            to give the rice a vibrant hue.
