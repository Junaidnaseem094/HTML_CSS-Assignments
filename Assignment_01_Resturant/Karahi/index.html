        <center>Karahi is a popular and aromatic dish that originates from the Indian subcontinent, particularly
            Pakistan and North India. Named after the utensil it is traditionally cooked in, a karahi (a deep, circular,
            and thick-bottomed cooking pot), this dish is known for its rich and robust flavors.</center>

        <center> Karahi typically consists of tender pieces of meat, such as chicken, lamb, or goat, cooked in a thick,
            tomato-based gravy infused with a medley of spices. The meat is often marinated with a combination of
            ginger, garlic, and yogurt to enhance its tenderness and flavor.</center>

        <center> The karahi gravy is made by simmering onions, tomatoes, and a blend of spices, including cumin,
            coriander, turmeric, and chili powder. The dish is further elevated with the addition of aromatic spices such as garam
            masala, dried fenugreek leaves, and fresh coriander.</center>

        <center>Karahi is appreciated for its vibrant and robust taste, with a perfect balance of tanginess, heat, and
            earthy flavors. It is typically served hot, straight from the karahi, accompanied by naan bread or rice.
            This beloved dish is a staple in South Asian cuisine and is enjoyed by both meat lovers and curry
            enthusiasts.</center>
