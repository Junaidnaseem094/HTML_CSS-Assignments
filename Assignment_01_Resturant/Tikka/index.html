        <center>Tikka is a beloved and flavorful dish that originated in the Indian subcontinent. It is known for its
            succulent pieces of marinated meat, usually chicken, cooked to perfection in a tandoor (clay oven) or on a
            grill. Tikka is renowned for its tender texture and tantalizing blend of spices.</center>

    <p>
        <center>The preparation of tikka begins with marinating the meat in a mixture of yogurt and an array of aromatic
            spices. Common spices used include cumin, coriander, turmeric, paprika, ginger, garlic, and chili powder.
            The meat is left to marinate for several hours or overnight, allowing the flavors to penetrate and infuse
            into the meat.</center>
    </p>

    <p>
        <center>Once marinated, the meat is traditionally skewered and cooked in a hot tandoor, resulting in a smoky and
            charred exterior while retaining its moistness. Alternatively, it can be cooked on a grill, yielding a
            similar effect.</center>
    </p>
    <p>
        <center>Tikka can be enjoyed on its own as a flavorful appetizer or served as the main ingredient in various
            dishes, such as tikka masala or tikka wraps. Its bold and aromatic flavors, combined with the tender and
            juicy meat, make tikka a popular and delightful choice for anyone seeking a taste of authentic Indian
            cuisine.</center>
