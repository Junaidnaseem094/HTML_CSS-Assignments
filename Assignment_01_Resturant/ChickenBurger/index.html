        <center>A chicken burger is a popular fast-food staple that offers a delectable twist on the classic beef
            burger. It features a succulent chicken patty, typically made from ground chicken or chicken breast,
            seasoned with a variety of spices and herbs.</center>

        <center>The chicken patty is often grilled, pan-fried, or breaded and deep-fried to achieve a crispy exterior
            and juicy interior. It is then placed on a soft burger bun and garnished with an array of toppings and
            condiments. Popular choices include fresh lettuce, ripe tomatoes, sliced onions, pickles, and a spread of
            mayonnaise or special sauces.</center>
