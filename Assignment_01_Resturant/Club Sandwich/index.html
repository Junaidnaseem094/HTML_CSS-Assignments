        <center>The club sandwich typically consists of slices of roasted turkey or chicken, along with crispy bacon,
            lettuce, and tomato. These ingredients are generously stacked between layers of bread, often toasted to add
            a satisfying crunch. Mayonnaise is spread on the bread to enhance the sandwich's creaminess and provide a
            tangy flavor.</center>
