        <center>Club Seekh Kebab is a tantalizing fusion dish that combines the best of two culinary worlds: the classic
            club sandwich and the traditional seekh kebab. This delectable creation features succulent and flavorful
            skewered kebabs nestled between layers of toasted bread, fresh vegetables, and zesty sauces.</center>
    </p>

    <p>
        <center>The star of the dish is the seekh kebab, which is made by marinating minced meat (usually lamb or beef)
            with
            a blend of aromatic spices, such as cumin, coriander, ginger, and garlic. The meat is then molded onto
            skewers and grilled to perfection, resulting in smoky and juicy kebabs that are packed with robust flavors.

        <center>To assemble the Club Seekh Kebab, the grilled kebabs are gently placed between slices of toasted bread,
            accompanied by crisp lettuce, sliced tomatoes, onions, and sometimes cheese. Creamy sauces like mint yogurt
            or tangy chutneys are generously drizzled over the kebabs, adding an extra layer of indulgence.</center>

            for both casual lunches and hearty dinners. It's a unique and delightful twist on two beloved dishes that is
