        <center>Dhaga kebab, also known as seekh kebab or skewered kebab, is a popular Indian and Pakistani delicacy
            that is loved for its succulent and smoky flavors. This kebab variation involves marinating minced or ground
            meat, typically chicken, lamb, or beef, with a blend of aromatic spices and herbs.</center>
    </p>

    <p>
        <center>The marinated meat is then threaded onto skewers, which gives the kebab its distinct shape. The skewers
            are traditionally made of metal or bamboo and are cooked over an open flame or on a grill, allowing the meat to
            acquire a delightful charred and smoky flavor.</center>

    <p>
        <center>Dhaga kebabs are often seasoned with spices like cumin, coriander, paprika, and garam masala, along with
            ingredients like ginger, garlic, and fresh herbs such as cilantro or mint. The kebabs are grilled to
            perfection, ensuring a juicy and tender texture.</center>
    </p>

    <p>
        <center>These flavorful kebabs are commonly served with naan bread, mint chutney, and a side of salad or raita
            (yogurt-based dip). Dhaga kebabs are a popular choice for barbecues, street food stalls, or as appetizers at
            festive gatherings, offering a delightful blend of smoky, aromatic, and savory flavors that are sure to
            please your taste buds.
