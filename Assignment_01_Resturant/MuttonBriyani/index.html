        <center>The preparation of Mutton Biryani involves marinating the mutton with a blend of yogurt and spices like
            turmeric, chili powder, cumin, and garam masala. The rice is parboiled separately and then layered with the
            marinated mutton, fried onions, and a generous amount of aromatic spices like cardamom, cloves, cinnamon,
            and bay leaves. Saffron-infused milk is often added to impart a beautiful golden hue to the rice.</center>

        <center> The layers are then cooked together, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to absorb the rich
            flavors of the mutton and spices. The result is a luxurious and hearty dish where each grain of rice is infused with
            the essence of the spices and the mutton becomes tender and succulent.</center>
