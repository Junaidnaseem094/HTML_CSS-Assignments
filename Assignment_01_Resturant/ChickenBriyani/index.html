        <center>Chicken Biryani is a beloved and iconic dish that originated in the Indian subcontinent. It is a
            flavorful and aromatic rice-based dish that brings together the best of Indian spices, tender chicken, and
            fragrant basmati rice.</center>
    </p>

    <p>
        <center> preparation of Chicken Biryani involves marinating chicken pieces in a blend of yogurt and spices, such
            as turmeric, chili powder, cumin, and coriander. The rice is parboiled and then layered with the marinated
            chicken, fried onions, and a generous amount of aromatic spices like cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and bay
            leaves. Saffron-infused milk is often added to give the rice a beautiful yellow hue.</center>

    <p>
        <center>The layers are then cooked together, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to absorb all the
            aromatic
            goodness. The result is a symphony of flavorsâ€”each grain of rice infused with the essence of the spices and
            tender, juicy pieces of chicken. The dish is garnished with fresh coriander leaves and served with raita
            (yogurt-based side dish) or salan (spicy curry).</center>

            mouthwatering taste. It is a favorite choice for special occasions, celebrations, or simply indulging in a
            hearty and delicious meal.</center>
