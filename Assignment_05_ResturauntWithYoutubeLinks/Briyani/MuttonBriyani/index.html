        Mutton Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish that features tender pieces of mutton (goat meat)
        cooked with fragrant basmati rice, aromatic spices, and herbs. It is a beloved dish that is popular in
        various regions, including the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, and South Asia.

        The preparation of Mutton Biryani involves marinating the mutton with a blend of yogurt and spices like
        turmeric, chili powder, cumin, and garam masala. The rice is parboiled separately and then layered with the
        marinated mutton, fried onions, and a generous amount of aromatic spices like cardamom, cloves, cinnamon,
        and bay leaves. Saffron-infused milk is often added to impart a beautiful golden hue to the rice.

        The layers are then cooked together, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to absorb the rich
        flavors of the mutton and spices. The result is a luxurious and hearty dish where each grain of rice is infused
        with
        the essence of the spices and the mutton becomes tender and succulent.
